# Own The Tone
So,this is my code for the tinnitus app  called Own The Tone that Mom asked me to design. I'm trying to get a beta before the end of summer.
Anyways Constants.dart contains the constants for the settings menu,aka the popup menu button. I'm mostly including that so I can have a settings page,and a about page. Moving on,I have yet to tackle the audio aspect,which will be the hardest part. I'm mostly just trying to get the UI built,then the pages,then I'll jump into getting the audio.
