# Own The Tone
So,this is my code for the tinnitus app  called Own The Tone that Mom asked me to design. I'm trying to get a beta before the end of summer.
Anyways Constants.dart contains the constants for the settings menu,aka the popup menu button. I'm mostly including that so I can have a settings page,and a about page. Moving on,audio aspect has been tackled,and is now in beta. Have to see if the people who comissioned it like it before I tweak it some more.


I'm using LuanPotter's audio player https://github.com/luanpotter/audioplayers
for remote url play,and am hosting the audio files for direct mp3 hosting on https://jukehost.co.uk/
