# Own The Tone
So,this is my code for the tinnitus app  called Own The Tone that Dr.Loney asked me to design. Currently in Alpha.


I'm using LuanPotter's audio player https://github.com/luanpotter/audioplayers
for remote url play,and am hosting the audio files for direct mp3 hosting on https://jukehost.co.uk/
